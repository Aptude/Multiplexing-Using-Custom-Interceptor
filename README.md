Multiplexing-Using-Custom-Interceptor
=====================================
Flume has the capability to modify the events in-flight by using interceptors based on any criteria.

The main objective of our Custom Interceptor and Multiplexing is to Split the header string by some criteria and the required header which we got after splitting the string should be given to Multiplexing part, so that Multiplexing maps (delivers)the events to the appropriate channels.
